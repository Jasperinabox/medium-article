    <h2>1. Choose a Broker or Crypto Exchange</h2>
      <p>To buy cryptocurrency, first you need to pick a broker or a crypto exchange. While either lets you buy crypto, there are a few key differences between them to keep in mind.</p>
    <h2>2. Create and Verify Your Account</h2>
      <p>Once you decide on a cryptocurrency broker or exchange, you can sign up to open an account. Depending on the platform and the amount you plan to buy, you may have to verify your identity. This is an essential step to prevent fraud and meet federal regulatory requirements.</p>
    <h2>3. Deposit Cash to Invest</h2>
      <p>To buy crypto, youâ€™ll need to make sure you have funds in your account. You might deposit money into your crypto account by linking your bank account, authorizing a wire transfer or even making a payment with a debit or credit card. Depending on the exchange or broker and your funding method, you may have to wait a few days before you can use the money you deposit to buy cryptocurrency.</p>
